# PrintedRC

You wouldnt download a car.. or would you? Welcome to the landing page of the colloquially named PrintedRC car, built by Benjamin Bega.

Though it originally starting a simple build of the [Tarmo5](https://www.printables.com/model/348623-3d-printed-rc-car-tarmo5/files), this project is now a hulking mass of an RC car, weighing nearly 4kg, and measuring approximately 60cm long in its largest form factor. It was not cheaper, faster, or easier than putting together a kit RC car, but it was a lot more fun, and should make for an excellent project breakdown below.
