# PrintedRC

You wouldnt download a car.. or would you? Welcome to the landing page of the colloquially named PrintedRC car, built by Benjamin Bega.

Though it originally starting a simple build of the [Tarmo5](https://www.printables.com/model/348623-3d-printed-rc-car-tarmo5/files), this project is now a hulking mass of an RC car, weighing nearly 4kg, and measuring approximately 60cm long in its largest form factor. It was not cheaper, faster, or easier than putting together a kit RC car, but it was a lot more fun, and should make for an excellent project breakdown below.

# Background 

The Tarmo5 is a great project, and the most popular 3D printed RC car for a reason. However, it realistically tops out at about 35 mph, and has some stability at higher speeds. The wheelbase is fairly short, and the default motor is a little smaller than I'd prefer. The Tarmo5 was a great starting point for my needs, but overall needed some significant changes if I wanted to hit some higher speeds. My original goal when starting this project was to build an RC car that could hit a top speed of 100 mph in a straight line, something I have not seen any 3D printed projects do.
